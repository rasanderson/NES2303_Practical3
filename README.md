# NES2303_Practical3

## Multiple explanatory variables
Covers two-way ANOVA, interaction terms and how to interpret them, quadratics to fit curves, unbalanced designs. Shiny apps explain how to use multiple explanatories, and give insights into how ANOVA 'works' to compare means by looking at variances.

## Things to do / think about
* Omit section on data wrangling (maybe move into optional additional reading / Stage 3 project section)
* Omit quadratic curve fitting? Need to curve how to deal with non-linear data somewhere perhaps?
* Be more explicit in text about what is meant by a factor as compared to continuous
* Move section on blocks to end of practical, and rename as 'How to improve experimental design' or similar
* Videos and 'good' / 'bad' examples of code need updating to reflect any changes in practical content.
